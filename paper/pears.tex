\subsection{Simulation details}\label{sec:methods-sims}
% what is it that we are trying to study? why use illustris?
To understand the occurance rate and separations of typical galaxy pairs in a cosmological context, we require a simulation that provides a large statistical sample of pairs in both the dwarf and massive galaxy regime. 
Thus, we are limited in our simulation choice to large-volume cosmological simulations. 
However, we also require high resolution simulations such that the dwarf subhalos are resolved well enough to ensure robust statistics at the low mass end, and so we are not limited by our inability to resolve objects down to halo masses of $M_{\rm halo}\approx1\times 10^9\, \Msun$.

% Baryonic processes
Baryonic process are known to affect the dark matter halo structure of low mass ($M_*<1\times10^9\Msun$) subhalos in simulations~\citep[see e.g.][and references therein]{Sales:2022}.
Additionally, the shallow potential well of dwarf galaxies compared to their massive counterparts may lend themselves more easily to disruption from baryonic processes such as supernova feedback, which could change the occurance rate of low mass subhalos in hydrodynamic simulations \kc{check and see if they looked at this in the TNG100 galaxy paper}.
To study the effect of baryonic processes on the rate and separation of pairs, we require cosmological simulations which have both dark matter only runs and to full hydrodynamics.

% details of Illustris and Illustris TNG
The \textit{Illustris Project} ~\citep{vogelsberger14A,nelson15} and \textit{IllustrisTNG Project}~\citep{TNG1, TNG2, TNG3, TNG4, TNG5} are a set of N-body and hydrodynamic cosmological simulations which are perfectly suited for such a study. 
We use the dark matter only and full hydrodynamic runs of both the \ill-1 and \tng100-1 simulations to explore the connection between pairs and baryonic processes. 
Each of these simulations follows the dynamical evolution of $1820^3$ dark matter particles from $z=127$ to $z=0$ through a periodic volume of roughly $100^3$ Mpc$^3$. 
The \ill{} simulations follow a cosmology consistent with \textit{WMAP-9}~\citep{hinshaw13}, while the \tng{} simulations are consistent with \textit{Planck2015}~\citep{Planck2015}.
Specifically, we use the \textit{Illustris-1-Dark}, \textit{Illustris-1}, \textit{TNG100-1-Dark}, and \textit{TNG100-1} simulations (hereafter \illd, \illh, \tngd, and \tngh{} respectively, see Table~\ref{table:sim} for details).

% deets on the hydrodynamics of 
\kc{hydrodynamics details on the difference between the two hydro simulations. also include differences between the two dark simulations, if there are any besides the cosmology. }

% subfind, sublink, and groups and subhalos
We utilize the group catalogs produced by the \texttt{SUBFIND} algorithm ~\citep{springel01,dolag09}. 
These catalogs consist of halos (or "groups"), defined using the Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm~\citep{davis85} to link nearby particles, and their associated subhalos, which are over-dense and gravitationally bound dark matter structures.
We also use the merger trees provided by the \texttt{SUBLINK} algorithm \citep{gomez15}, which tracks subhalos between snapshots using their particle data, in order to trace the mass growth and merger histories of our subhalos.

\subsection{Abundance matching prescription}\label{sec:methods-am}
% Why do we need stellar masses?
One of the goals of this study is to determine the impact of baryonic physics on the occurance rate and typical separations of galaxy \kc{subhalo?} pairs in cosmological simulations. 
However, selecting halo pairs by stellar mass ratio using the stellar masses provided by the simulations is not possible in the dark matter only runs. 
Thus, in order ensure the dark matter only and full hydrodynamic samples are self-consistent, we need to associate each of the selected subhalos with a realistic stellar mass.

% What is abundance matching
Abundance matching is one such method of associating a dark matter halo with a stellar mass, assuming a galaxy would form in a halo of that mass. 

However, there is large scatter in the stellar-mass-halo-mass (SMHM) relationship, especially in the dwarf halo regime. 



% How do we utilize it? 
In particular, we use the abundance matching relationship presented in~\citet{moster13}, which provides an analytic recipe to paint stellar masses onto dark matter halos. 
The~\citet{moster13} relationship is a redshift-evolving function of the halo mass, and includes terms to account for the systematic scatter in the SMHM relationship, with larger scatter at lower halo masses.
\kc{why moster instead of another AM relationship? most closely represent data at lower mass? }

To assign stellar masses to each of the dark matter halos, we assume that the stellar mass of both the primary and secondary halo can change as a function of redshift after the secondary has entered the primary's halo and do not immediately cease star formation.
This assumption is consistent with findings from~\cite{Akins2021}, which found that massive dwarf satellites ($M_*\approx 10^8-10^9\, \Msun$) entering MW-mass host halos are rarely quenched, and with~\cite{geha13} which finds that isolated dwarfs ($>1\Mpc$ from a MW-type galaxy) are often star forming and rarely quenched.
Additionally,~\citet{Munshi2021} found that the stellar mass of subhalos at $z=0$ in the XX simulations are more closely correlated with the peak halo mass than the $z=0$ halo mass for halos with peak halo mass $10^8<M_{\rm peak}<10^{11} \Msun$. 

Thus, we treat each of the subhalos as centrals according to the~\citet{moster13} prescription, using the current snapshot redshift and the peak halo mass of the subhalo to calculate the stellar mass. 
This additionally allows us remain robust to scenarios in which a secondary may have formed most of its stars, and then lost a significant portion of its dark matter content through tidal interactions with a primary, but will retain the bulk of its stellar content.

We create 1000 stellar mass realizations from the SMHM relationship, thus accounting for the systematic uncerntainy in subhalo stellar masses. Each realization is treated as an independent sample, such that computed properties (pair frequency, separations, etc) are given as the median each realization. We report the mean of all realizations and error bars indicate the 1$\sigma$ dispersion across the realizations.
%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Selection criteria}\label{sec:methods-crit}
In this section, we outline the selection criteria used to select dwarf and massive subhalo pairs. 
The same selection criteria is utilized for all four simulations (\illd, \illh, \tngd, and \tngh)
In short, blah. 
Detailed steps are as follows. 

\subsubsection{Isolation}
As we are interested in the frequency and separations of galaxy pairs that are undisturbed by nearby massive perturbers, we select subhalo pairs as the most massive subhalos of their group halos. 
We have confirmed that nearly 100\% of the the most massive subhalos in each group are outside of the Hill radius of any nearby subhalo with greater mass, and are thus a rough isolation criteria is inherent in our selection.

\textbf{Definitions:} each of these defines the subhalo at a single snapshot and for a single realization.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Primary - Most massive subhalo in a group by stellar mass
  \item Secondary - 
  \item Major pair - A pair of subhalos consisting of a primary and secondary with stellar mass ratio $1/4 < \rm M_{*,sec}/M_{*, prim} < 1$
  \item Minor pair - A pair of subhalos consisting of a primary and secondary with stellar mass ratio $1/10 < \rm M_{*,sec}/M_{*, prim} < 1/4$
\end{itemize}
Note that the subhalo that is assigned as primary or secondary may change between stellar mass realizations. Also note\kc{that this method may yield pairs where the secondary has a higher subhalo mass than the primary. This one happens ~XX\% of the time.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select groups in some group range that encompasses MCs and MW-M31
  \item For every subhalo in every group with halo mass >1e9Msun, use merger trees to get the maximum masses.
  \item Generate 1000 stellar mass realization using abundance matching so we can account for the spread in the relationship
  \item Generate catalog at each redshift containing: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For each realization, and in each group with a single subhalo, add the subhalo and it's properties to a catalog of single halos.
    \item For each realization, and in each group with 2+ halos, find most massive halo by stellar mass, and the second most massive halo by stellar mass, then add to pair catalog. 
    \item If a group has 3+ halos, check the stellar mass of the third most massive object, and see if it is a major/minor companion of the secondary. If not, teritary flag = 0. Otherwise =1.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Select dwarf primaries: for full catalog, most massive halo (in "pairs") or single halos with stellar mass $1\times10^{8} < \msam < 5\times10^{9} \Msun$. 
  \item Select dwarf pairs: for full pair catalog, any pair with stellar mass ratio between 1-1/4 (major pairs) or between 1/4-1/10 (minor pairs). All pairs is the union of these two sets. Any pair or single halo that is outside of these two sets is an "unpaired" halo. Note that unpaired can still have very minor companions. 
\end{enumerate}

The lower mass threshold for subhalos that constitute our dwarf pairs have a halo mass greater than $1\times10^9\Msun$, such that each of our halos are resolved into at least 100 particles in each simulation.

\section{Results}
We collect dwarf pairs and massive pairs at all snapshots from the TNG100-1 simulation and analyze the occurrence rate and kinematic behavior of the pairs across cosmic time. 
At each snapshot, we generate 1000 different realizations of the pair catalog, where each realization represents one instance of the abundance matching technique to assign stellar masses to dark matter halos (see methods). 
In each of the following plots, the median and a percentile spread each value are calculated by finding the median from each of the 1000 AM realizations, and taking the median and spread of that set of median values.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:results-frac}, we show the redshift evolution of the fraction of primaries with a major or minor companion/secondary, and compare the "pair fractions" of dwarf pairs and massive pairs.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:results-kinematics}, we look at the redshift evolution of the median separations and relative velocities between primary and secondary halos on a snapshot-by-snapshot basis.


\subsection{Pair fraction}\label{sec:results-frac}
Thus, the rate of dwarf pairs and massive pairs \textit{per primary} will evolve distinctly in the dwarf and massive pair case.

      % massive pairs
    The fraction of massive primaries (pink) with a major (left) or minor (right) companion remains approximately constant for $z>1$, with an average pair fraction of 0.16-0.17 and 0.14-0.15 respectively. Between $z=0.25$ and $z=0$, the massive major pair fraction increases sharply from 0.165 to 0.207, a 25\% increase, while the minor pair fraction increases from 0.127 to 0.152, a 20\% increase.
      % dwarf pairs
    Dwarf pairs (green), on the other hand, have pair fractions that are approximately constant from $z=3-4$, but the fraction of major(minor) pairs declines monotonically from 0.126(0.111) at x=3 to just 0.041(0.034) at x=0, a 67(70)\% decrease.

This shows that the redshift evolution of the pair fractions of massive pairs and dwarf pairs proceed differently, particularly in the low redshift regime.}

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Kinematic evolution}\label{sec:results-kinematics}
The primary and secondary halos of each pair at each individual snapshot/redshift is separated by some physical separation and has a relative velocity of 

We separate the population of dwarf and massive pairs into "major" and "minor" pairs (as defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:methods-crit-pairs}) to show how the stellar mass ratio between the primary and secondary may affect the kinematics. 

At each individual snapshot, we find the median separation 

\subsubsection{Physical Separations}
The median separations of dwarf and massive pairs increases with lower redshift, regardless of pair type. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:sep} shows the median and 1-99\% range of separations for dwarf pairs and massive pairs, as well as the subtracted difference between the median separation of major pairs and of minor pairs of both mass type. 
Both dwarf and massive pairs have smoothly evolving medians that increase with decreasing redshift. 
There is a small offset in the median separations of major and minor dwarf pairs (between $10-25\,\kpc$ from  $z=0-1$ and approximately $5\,\kpc$ from $z=1-4$), and a larger median separation offset for major and minor massive pairs (between $25-100\,\kpc$ from  $z=0-1$ and approximately $10-40\,\kpc$ from $z=1-4$). 
Thus, apart from the overall scale of the separations between primary and secondary, dwarf and massive pairs exhibit similar trends as a function of time. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:sep-dist} shows the full distribution of separations for major and minor dwarf and massive pairs at $z=\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ for all 1000 AM realizations.

  Major pairs (high stellar mass ratio) are shown in solid lines, while minor pairs are depicted with dashed lines.
  In general, as the redshift decreases from $z=4$ to $z=0$, the average physical separation of a pair increases for both dwarf and massive pairs. 
  % Dwarf pairs
  The redshift evolution of the dwarf pairs closely resembles a power law distrbution across the whole redshift range from $z=0-4$.
  At $z=4$, the typical separation between major (minor) dwarf pairs is XX(XX) kpc, and peaks at $z=0$ with a median separation of XX (xx).

  The separation between massive pairs, on the other hand, increases approximately linearly from $z=4$, where the median separations of major (minor) pairs is XX(XX), to $z=1$, where median separations are XX(XX).

    As the redshift decreases from $z=4$ to $z=0$, the average relative velocity of a pair decreases as well for both dwarf and massive pairs.
    % brief describe
    The median relative velocity of a dwarf pair (major or minor) is $xx$ at $z=0$ and $xx$ at $z=4$, and of a massive pair is $xx$ at $z=0$ and $xx$ at $z=4$. 
    % Difference plot
    (Bottom) The median subtracted relative velocity difference between major and minor pairs, and 1-99\% shaded region.
    The is little difference between major and minor dwarf pairs (bottom left), with minor pairs having a relative velocity of $0-5\kms$ higher than major pairs. 
    Major and minor massive pairs also have very little median velocity difference at low redshift (bottom right), with minor pairs having a relative velocity between $1-20\kms$ faster than major pairs.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Pair ratio fig. -- The vast difference between the dwarf and massive pair fractions suggests \todo{XX - that pairs at different mass scales evolve differently ? Thus, can't just assume a massive pair fraction for a lower mass regime} 

Mean separation fig. -- The increase in low redshift median separations suggests that low separation pairs undergo mergers that remove them from the sample at later snapshots, thus increasing the median separation over time.

Separation dist fig. -- The number of widely separated pairs at low redshift is much greater than at high redshift, so these pairs either form late, or move apart from each other. 

Scaled sep fig. -- \textbf{The difference between the scaled separations of dwarf and massive pairs highlights the mass dependence of the physical distribution of halo pairs, i.e., dwarf pairs are not simply a smaller scale version of massive pairs.}

Scaled vel fig. --   \textbf{Despite the difference between dwarf and massive pairs in physical distribution as indicated by the plot of scaled separations (Figure~\ref{fig:sep-scaled}), the scaled velocity distribution of pairs indicates that dwarf and massive galaxy pairs operate similarly in velocity space. There is little to no mass dependence on the scaled velocity of dwarf or massive pairs.}
Also note than many of the close pairs at high z may merge by $z=0$.

  \caption{Median scaled separation (separation of a pair divided by the virial radius of its group) as a function of redshift. Dwarf pairs (major (solid) and minor (dashed)) tend to have smaller scaled separations at lower redshifts, leveling out between $z=0-1$. In particular, the secondaries of dwarf major pairs at $z>2$ tend to live more than one virial radius away from the primary. Massive major pairs at low redshift tend to have smaller scaled separations  at $z<\sim2$, but vary significantly at higher redshifts. 
  Minor pairs (right), both dwarf and massive, tend to have smaller separations, tending to live closer than one virial radius between the primary and secondary. Massive minor pairs tend to have smaller scaled separations compared to dwarf pairs at all redshifts.
